## Hi there 👋, I'm Abdallah Nassur

🎓 I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Big Data & AI at IPSSI (Paris).

💼 I’m also working as a Software Engineer at Powens, _"Where Open Finance Meets Embedded Banking"_.

💡 Passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, and Web Development, I enjoy turning ideas into real-world projects. Some of my recent works include:
- Building a full-stack app with OCR + LLM to extract structured data from resumes.
- Developing a RAG-based assistant for document search and Q&A.
- Training ML models for text classification (e.g., spam detection).

⚙️ Tech stack I work with: Python, SQL, React.js, MongoDB, Docker, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis.

**Curious, rigorous, and always learning**, I’m eager to contribute to innovative projects.
